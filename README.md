# Somali-Word-Replacer-Xun-Wanaagsan-Nacas-Fariid---Customizable-C-Program
This C program replaces "xun" with "wanaagsan" (good) and "nacas" with "fariid" (wise) in files. 
It supports UTF-8, handles dynamic text resizing, and outputs to "output.txt". 
Easily modifiable for other word swaps.

Run with: ./program input.txt. Customize replacements by editing the code. Preserves original file structure.
